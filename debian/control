Description: grid-based manual tiling window manager
 Grid-based manual tiling window manager with a strong focus on easy but
 customizable look and feel.
 .
 In comparison to other tiling window managers,
 subtle has no automatic tiling of the screen size in any way. Instead, windows
 are arranged according to positions inside of a grid. These positions are
 called gravities.
